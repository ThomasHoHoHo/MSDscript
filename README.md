## MSDscript Interpreter

A C++ Scripting Language Implementation with Qt GUI

Project Owner: Thomas Ho

## Overview

MSDscript is an interpreted scripting language implementation featuring arithmetic operations, variables, functions, and advanced memory management. Developed as part of advanced software construction coursework, this project demonstrates core compiler/interpreter concepts through 12 iterative development phases.

## Key capabilities:

Expression Evaluation: Arithmetic operations, variable binding, and conditional logic
Function Support: First-class functions with lexical scoping
Memory Safety: Smart pointers for automatic garbage collection
Testing Framework: Randomized property-based testing
Toolchain Integration: Makefile build system with Catch2 testing

## Tech Stack:
- Core Language: C++ 17
- GUI Framework: Qt 6
- Testing: Catch2
- Build System: CMake
- Memory Management: Smart Pointers (std::shared_ptr)


## This educational project evolved through 12 development phases to implement:
- Recursive-descent parser with AST generation
- Environment-based interpreter with closure support
- Smart pointer memory management system
- Property-based test framework
- Qt-based debugging interface

## Key Features âœ¨

### 1. Advanced Grammar Parsing
```bnf
<expr> = <number> 
       | <expr> + <expr>
       | <expr> * <expr>
       | <variable>
       | _let <var> = <expr> _in <expr>
       | _if <expr> _then <expr> _else <expr>
```

### 2. Mathematical Execution Engine
```bnf
3 + 5 * 2        # Interps to 13
(2 + 3) * (4 - 1) # Interps to 15
1 + 2 == 3       # Evaluates to _true
```
